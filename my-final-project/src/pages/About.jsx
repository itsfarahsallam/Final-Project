              <p>My name is Farah and I'm a twenty-something Library Tech interested in birds, knitted crafting, programming, and literature.</p>
              <p>I was born and raised in Northern California, but about a year ago, I took flight, and headed towards the Pacific Northwest which I now reside.</p>
              <p>This site is my final project for a web scripting class. However, this site was also created as a way to display my newfound love for birds.</p>
              <p>I've only seriously started birding for about a month, but I gained much interest thanks to my partner and his interest. </p>
